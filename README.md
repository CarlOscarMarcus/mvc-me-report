This repository contains several projects completed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course focused on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.  

Projects include a library database application, a blackjack game featuring a bank system and multiple game functionalities, and other assorted features demonstrating OOP and MVC principles. Each project illustrates practical usage of PHP, object orientation, and MVC design to build interactive web applications.

## Getting Started

To clone this repository, copy the repository URL and run:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
After cloning, install dependencies and start a local development server by running:
```bash
composer up
```

This will start the built-in PHP server and open the application in your browser on port 8888, serving files from the public directory.

If you want to run the repository from another directory or specify a custom document root, use the PHP built-in server directly:

```bash
php -S localhost:8888 -t <directory>
```

Replace <directory> with the desited web root.

# Notes
This repository is primarily for educational purposes.

Feel free to explore the different projects and functionalities to understand MVC and OOP patterns in PHP.
